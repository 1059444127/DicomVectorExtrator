# DICOM_TRANSFORMER
Dicom File processor for Antidote Biomedical

This solution is a quick and rough proof of concept for extracting vector data from dicom files. 

If successfull, it will be refactored into a class library. 

.Net CORE has been used as the framework to permit it to be compiled for many opearating systems. 

It is currently only windows centric, so more repositories and factories need to be added for other operating system after 
the concept is proven to be acceptable to the client.
